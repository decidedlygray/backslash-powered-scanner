# backslash-powered-scanner
This extension complements complements Burp's active scanner by using a novel approach capable of finding and confirming both known and unknown classes of server-side injection vulnerabilities. Evolved from classic manual techniques, this approach reaps many of the benefits of manual testing including casual WAF evasion, a tiny network footprint, and flexibility in the face of input filtering.

For more information, please refer to the whitepaper at http://blog.portswigger.net/2016/11/backslash-powered-scanning-hunting.html

The code can be found at https://github.com/portswigger/backslash-powered-scanner Contributions and feature requests are welcome.

# Installation
This extension requires Burp Suite Pro 1.7.10 or later. To install it, simply use the BApps tab in Burp.

If you want to manually build/install it from source, you'll need to add the following JAR to your libraries: https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/download_lang.cgi

This dependency will be removed shortly.

# Local Build Instructions (Windows only)
A Windows PowerShell build script is located in `build\build.ps1`. It will handle downloading the commons-lang dependency, compiling source code, and JAR'ing up the results so they are ready for import to Burp Pro.
